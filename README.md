# PDF-Converter

A Python script is utilized for converting PDF files into PNG format, with the purpose of merging multiple PDF files into one.

To use the script, the user must first modify the folder path in pdf_convert.py to point to the directory containing the PDF files. Once this is done, the script can be executed. However, it is important to note that the script will delete the original PDF files once the conversion process is complete. It is strongly advised that users ensure they have a backup of all PDF files before executing the script, as the files will be permanently deleted otherwise.
